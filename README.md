# EyeBallTracking - Sam's Branch (WORK IN PROGRESS)

# Project summary
Python application that will allow users with impaired hand functionality to use a Windows computer to the same capacity as everyone else.
 This will be done by using eye tracking technology to detect where on the screen the user is looking and to tell when the user either 
 blinks or winks intentionally to detect a mouse click

## Crosshair-Stabilizer
This application I have created helps track mouse movemnet and if the user was to not move their mouse for 5 seconds then the application will pull the mouse back to the center.
 This will help out when calibrating and converting to the human joystick model idea

# Software Features

## Hands Free Mouse:
The user will then be able to control the mouse by looking at diffrent parts of the screen, left and right click with diffrent blink 
patterns as well as double click and scroll up and down.
