# EyeBallTracking

# Project summary
Python application that will allow users with impaired hand functionality to use a Windows computer to the same capacity as everyone else.

 blinks or winks intentionally to detect a mouse click

# Software Features

## Hands Free Mouse:
The user will then be able to control the mouse by turning their face to look at diffrent parts of the screen, left and right click with 
diffrent blink patterns as well as double click and scroll up and down.
