# EyeBallTracking

# Project summary
Python application that will allow users with impaired hand functionality to use a Windows computer to the same capacity as everyone else.
 This will be done by using face and eye tracking technology to detect where on the screen the user is looking and to tell when the user either 
 blinks or winks intentionally to detect a mouse click

# Software Features

## Hands Free Mouse:
The user will then be able to control the mouse by turning their face to look at diffrent parts of the screen, left and right click with 
diffrent blink patterns as well as double click and scroll up and down.
