NOTES:
=-= need to make changes; some big, some small. =-=
-i can break the while function into separate functions and files for ease of access and readability.
-using only the head for direction is not the intended outcome, so I will attempt to track either one or both eyes.
-adding more gestures for the eyes and head is ideal as well, but should be put off for later.
-a GUI would be nice once we have the need for it, for accessibility, customization, and more.
-I have not yet tested the event in which multiple faces are present.
